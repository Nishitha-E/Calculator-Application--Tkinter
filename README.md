# Calculator-Application--Tkinter
This project is a simple yet functional calculator application built using Python and the Tkinter library. The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, with a user-friendly graphical interface.
Features:
Supports basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Provides additional functions like parentheses, percentage calculation, and decimal input.
Clear button to reset the input and output field.
Error handling for invalid inputs.
A responsive graphical user interface designed with Tkinter.
Technologies Used:
Python 3.x: The core logic for the calculator operations and Tkinter for the graphical interface.
Tkinter: Python's built-in library for creating GUI applications, used for designing the calculator layout and handling user interactions.
Usage:
Clone the repository and run the script.
The calculator window will appear, allowing users to input numbers and operations using buttons.
Press the "=" button to evaluate the expression or "C" to clear the input.
How to Run:
Install Python 3.x if not already installed.
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-link>
Run the calculator.py file:
bash
Copy code
python calculator.py
Future Enhancements:
Implement additional advanced operations like square root, power, etc.
Add keyboard support for inputs.
Enhance the UI for better user experience.
